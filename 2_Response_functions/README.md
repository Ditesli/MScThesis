### 1_Replicate_RF_NoAdaptation.py
This file uses Carleton et al.'s data to replicate the mortality temperature response functions without adaptation. The response functions will be saved in three different .csv files: oldest.csv, older.csv, and young.csv. Each row corresponds to an impact region and the columns corresponds to a decigrade. The entries of the files refer to the number of deaths in a specific temperature and impact region.
